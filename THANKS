The Warlock Team would like to thank in no particular order:

- Chris Schantz for having the original idea to write a
  graphical dragonrealms frontend for linux. warlock 0.1 and 0.2
  were his creations.

- The author of the now deceased Elmekia Frontend (name?)
  for providing us with a very good start (SIMU-PROTOCOL)
  on parsing the GS protocol.

- Bloodmoon Academy for providing us with an example of a working
  login client. This was the basis for the original druid.

- The gtk, sourceforge, cvs, gaim, vim, autotools, xmms, mozilla
  (and many more) teams for providing us with an awesome
  development environment.

- All of the users we've had over the years, you are the best! :)
