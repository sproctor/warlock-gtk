Here's how SGE communicates with the servers.

the login server is eaccess.play.net on port 7900

First they send a line about what version they're using something like:

AL4334 SGE16 1 14

I don't know what most of this means.
The server sends back "CURRENT", or I'm assuming something different if we
aren't using the newest SGE. This doesn't matter to us.

Next SGE sends a single line (note: a line ends with "\n") consisting of "K"

the simu server responds with a hash string (it will be exactly 32 chars long), which you will encrypt the password with (I think the hash is always 7-bit
ASCII)

Encryption:
----------
here is a basic encryption function:
char *sge_encrypt_password (char *passwd, char *hash)
{
        int i;
        char *final;

        final = g_new (char, 33);
        for (i = 0; i < 32 && passwd[i] != '\0' && hash[i] != '\0'; i++) {
                final[i] = (char)((hash[i] ^ (passwd[i] - 32)) + 32);
        }
        final[i] = '\0';

        return final;
}

next, SGE sends a single line, consisting of the char 'A', the account name,
and the encrypted password seperated by a tabs (denoted by \t)
ex. A\tproctors1\t....\n

next, the server will send back a line starting with 'A', and some extra junk.
A\tACCOUNTNAME\tKEY\tkey\tName Of User\n
or A\t\tPASSWORD\n on an invalid password
or A\t\tNORECORD\n on an invalid user name

next SGE sends M\n

the server responds with a list of games M\tCS\tCyberstrike \tDR\tDragonRealms\tDRDT\tDragonRealms Dev Test\t... etc.

next SGE sends N\tCS\n

the server responds with information about that game N\tPRODUCTION|WIN95_ONLY\n

repeat this step for all games.

next SGE sends a line F\tDR\n or with whatever game code was last used.

the server responds with F\tNORMAL\n I have no idea what this exchange is for.

next, SGE sends 'G' , and the game selected to play.(seperated by tab)
ex. G\tDR\n

next, the server will send a line starting with 'G' with other info
G\tGameName\tNORMAL\t0\t\tROO=...\tMKTG=... etc

Next SGE sends P and a gamecode ex: P\tDR\n

the server reponse with P\t and god knows what

next, SGE sends a single line with 'C' C\n

next, the server will send a line beginning with C and a list of the
characters, and their character codes.
ex. C\t3\t3\t0\t0\CHAR_CODE\tCharacter Name\t...

everything is seperated by tab, and the first 4 values after the C are useless
if anyone knows exactly what these mean. I imagine they're characters,
character slots, then no idea what the 0's are for.

next, SGE will send 'L', the character code, and PLAY, all seperated by tab:
ex. L\tW_PROCTORS1_A003\tPLAY\n

next, the server will send a line beginning with 'L', and has all the necessary information for warlock/the wizard
ex. L\tOK\tUPPORT=5535\tGAME=WIZ\tGAMECODE=DR\tFULLGAMENAME=Wizard Front End\tGAMEFILE=WIZARD.EXE\tGAMEHOST=dr.simutronics.net\tGAMEPORT=4901\tKEY=29146988ad04cd375f52fd398e23960d\n

The key here should be 32 characters and the same as the one received after the
A code.

Hope this was helpful :)
