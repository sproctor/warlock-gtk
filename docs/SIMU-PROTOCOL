Things I have discovered about logging into the Simutronics game(s):

If you log into 198.83.208.169 [chimera-208.simutronics.com] and send the
following:

*** Substitute the IP of the game you play, for Dragonrealms it is
*** 198.83.208.176, port 4901

<key>\n
<key>\n              <-- \n == newline

*** You only need to send the key once, just a plain newline for the second
*** line works fine

...turns off status strings... but...

If you log into 198.83.208.169 [chimera-208.simutronics.com] and send the 
following:

<key>\n
/FE:WIZARD /VERSION:2.02 /P:WIN32\n       <-- \n == newline
GOOD\n

*** You only need to send /FE:WIZARD\n
*** anything else is just to tell the game what client/platform is connecting

...this will turn on status strings to the client.  Status strings consist
 of a new line and then ^\GSxxxxxxxx where the x(s) is some number of
characters.

Some of the strings I have figured out are:

^\GSm<string> - What is contained in your right hand.
^\GSl<string> - What is contained in your left hand.
These codes are sent with 45 characters. these 45 characters should be broken
into 3 sections of 15. each section is padded with spaces at the end, to fill
out the 15 characters. if no spaces are needed, none are added.

^\GSj<string> - The string will consist of the characters A-K, where each 
letter means the following:
 A - North
 B - Northeast
 C - East
 D - Southeast
 E - South
 F - Southwest
 G - West
 H - Northwest
 I - Up
 J - Down
 K - Out

 Also - this signifies the end of the items in a room, and the beginning of the "Obvious exits" section

^\GSX<number> - The amount of hit points you currently have.
              - The first digit can be '-', indicating negative hit points.
*** Not used in Dragonrealms

^\GSY<number> - The number of spirit points you currently have.
*** Not used in Dragonrealms

^\GSZ<10 digit number> - The amount of mana you currently have.
              - The first digit can be '-', indicating negative mana.
*** Not used in Dragonrealms

^\GSg<10 digit number> - Current stance.
 <number> == 000 - Offensive Stance
 <number> == 020 - Advanced Stance
 <number> == 040 - Forward Stance
 <number> == 060 - Neutral Stance
 <number> == 080 - Guarded Stance
 <number> == 100 - Defensive Stance
*** Not used in Dragonrealms

^\GSP<string> - status codes
 B - ?
 C - Webbed
 G - Lying down
 H - Sitting
 GH - Kneeling
 I - Stunned
 K - Sleeping?
 M - ?
 N - Hidden
 O - Bleeding?
 P - Joined to someone
 T - Spell RT?
 U - ???Bandaged???
 W - Dead

^\GSJ<number> - Get this when poisoned
ex. GSJ000000736100000000060000000001
there are three 10-digit numbers. the first one is unknown significance,
the second one is the amount of damage per round, and the third one is the rate
of dissipation.

^\GSw00003 - Sequence that shows up before a death.
^\GSw00004 - Sequence that shows up after a death.
*** These 2 tell the client that anything between them is a death and should 
    be displayed in the deaths window

^\GSa<number sequence> - Wounds/Severity?

^\GSb<number sequence> - Scars/Severity?

^\GSt - ?
*** seems to be sent whenever the items in your hands are changed (GSl and GSm
    codes)

^\GSrA - ?
from gemstone, not used in DR. I have no idea what it means.

^\GSQ<string> - when the round time ends.
^\GSq<string> - the current time

*** These are used to setup the times for the roundtime graphical display.
*** If a GSQ is sent, then the roundtime is initiated.
*** To get the roundtime, you take the string from the GSQ and subtract the
*** next GSq string from it, ie.
*** ^\GSQ0972325053
*** ^\GSq0972325047
*** 0972325053 - 0972325047 = a roundtime of 6 seconds

*** The GSq code also tells the wizard to display the prompt "\n>"

^\GSA<string> - ? - maybe initial setting of ^\GSq<string>...
                    Has been seen with, and without the game name at the end.
                    Only seen at login.
*** I get a ^\GSB before this at login as well... weird.  -Sean

^\GSD - get this at login, don't have any idea. -Sean

^\GSn<string> - Spell being prepared.

^\GSB<number><name> - Don't know what the <number> is, but <name> seems to
                      be the characters first name...
                      Only seen at login.
                      wizard sends "GOOD\n" in response to this.

^\GSV<really long number> - Tons of status info, maybe?  The number is really
                           long.
                           Only seen at login.

^\GSF<character><number> - Character has been seen to be B, M, and P - the
                           number has always been a long string of zeroes.
                           Only seen at login.
*** From what I have seen in Dragonrealms, the number has always been a string
*** of 10 zeroes.
*** Also, I have noticed that this code appears just before you enter a room,
*** and all 3 codes (GSFB, GSFM, GSFP) consistently appear together, in that
*** order.
*** Code GSFP is also sent when you "look" at a critter.
*** I'm thinking it is the code sent to display a picture.

^\GSL - monster bold highlight start

^\GSM - monster bold highlight end

^\GSC - Seen when you quit the game.
*** This tells the wizard to exit

^\GSo - ? - Seen before room title
*** I assume this is used to set the textcolor to White? I could be wrong.
*** Also used for the 'move' command in scripting

^\GSp - ? - Seen after room title
*** I assume this is used to set the textcolor back to the default, once again
*** I could be wrong.

^\GSH - ? - Seen after room title
*** This tells you that the room description is coming next

^\GSI - ? - Seen after room description (seperator between room and items?)
*** This seperates the room description and the items on the ground. However,
*** this follows the description directly, there is no newline between them.

^\GSW - ? - Seen when status changes with bleeders

^\GSc, ^\GSe - This seems to initialize the Familiar/Wounds window and ^\GSd, ^\GSf seems to finish it (maybe?)
