Warlock TODO
------------

For 0.5

- have system messages get their own tag

Maybe 0.5
- get javascript working
- support for names
- search text view for some text
- implement triggers
- Figure out what U is

Future

- make arrival, etc remember their size and position
- save last selected profile in gconf

- make start script, pause script, last command, etc macros. remove the
  hard-coded keys
- {scriptlet} macro command. switches entry into a script reader. you type
  script code and it interprets the code as you type it, pausing when it needs
  more code. hitting the macro again should switch back, but not clear the
  script. hit escape to end the script.
- navigation with compass
- implement \a for macros

- move images to png or svg files and make them prettier
- force close after some time when the close button is clicked
- squelch lines; also, allow users to define windows and send text to them.
  this can replace the way thoughts, arrivals, etc works.
- implement interface for showing poison/disease

- be able to create a new character through SGE
- redo profile dialog to show what is happening, not the entry stuff when
  connecting/doing the next step. whichever.
- back button in SGE interface
- support telnet-based muds

- support stormfront protocol
- port to windows
- per character preferences/highlights
- support multiple connections at once through tabs
- support importing preferences from the wizard
- Allow recording of scripts
- implement aliases http://ytin.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/help.pl/ytin?alias
- add sync function from wizard

Possible:

- support multiple wizard scripts at once
- implement call/return for scripts.
- ThreadCall label name: starts a thread at the label, identified by name.
- ThreadStop name, ThreadPause name, ThreadResume name, etc work on that thread
- implement DRConnect scripts: http://www.dr-connect.zinious.com/
- Import Wizard Configuration
- EXP Calculator (maybe?)
